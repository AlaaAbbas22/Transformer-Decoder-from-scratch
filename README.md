# Transformer-Decoder-from-scratch
Fine-tuning a Transformer Decoder Model for Text Classification


Technical Aspects

The model utilizes a Transformer architecture, specifically a decoder-only model similar to GPT, for next-word prediction.  This architecture is based on the "Attention is All You Need" paper.  

Key components include:

* **Self-Attention Mechanism:**  Allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence when predicting the next word. This is crucial for capturing long-range dependencies in text.

* **Positional Encoding:**  Since the Transformer architecture doesn't inherently process sequential data, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings to provide information about the word order.

* **Feed-Forward Networks:**  These networks process the output of the self-attention mechanism, further transforming the representations.

* **Decoder Layers:**  Multiple decoder layers are stacked, each consisting of self-attention and feed-forward networks.  The output of one layer serves as the input to the next, allowing for hierarchical feature extraction.

## End-to-End Implementation

1. **Data Preparation:** The model uses a dataset (likely loaded using the `datasets` library) and a tokenizer (from the `transformers` library) to process text data. This involves tokenization (converting text into numerical representations), creating input IDs, and attention masks.

2. **Model Initialization:**  A pre-trained Transformer model (likely from the `transformers` library) is instantiated.  If no pre-trained model is available, a model architecture needs to be defined from scratch.

3. **Inference (Next Word Prediction):**
   - The input prompt is tokenized.
   - The model iteratively predicts the next word based on the current sequence.
   - The predicted word's ID is appended to the input sequence, and the process repeats.
   - The prediction loop continues until a special token (e.g., end-of-sequence or separator token) is predicted or a maximum sequence length is reached.

4. **Decoding:** The predicted token IDs are decoded back into text using the tokenizer.

## Training the Model  

1. **Dataset and DataLoader:** A labeled dataset with input sequences and corresponding target next words, along with a DataLoader to efficiently feed data to the model.

2. **Loss Function:**  Cross-Entropy Loss is commonly used for next-word prediction tasks.

3. **Optimizer:**  AdamW or other suitable optimizers are typically employed.

4. **Training Loop:** Iteratively feed batches of data to the model, compute the loss, calculate gradients, and update model parameters using backpropagation.

5. **Evaluation Metrics:**  Perplexity and accuracy are common metrics for evaluating language models.

## When to Use a Decoder-Only Architecture?

Decoder-only architectures, like the one used in this example, are suitable for:

* **Text generation:**  Tasks such as next word prediction, text completion, and story generation, where the model generates text sequentially.
* **Language modeling:** Predicting the probability of the next word in a sequence.
* **Machine translation (with modifications):** While traditionally done with an encoder-decoder, decoder-only architectures can be adapted.

**When to consider an Encoder-Decoder Architecture?**

Encoder-decoder architectures are better suited for tasks where you have a separate input and output sequence and the output sequence's length might differ from the input sequence length:

* **Machine Translation:** Input is a sentence in one language, and the output is a translation in another.
* **Summarization:** Input is a long document, and the output is a shorter summary.
* **Question Answering:** Input is a question and a context, and the output is an answer.

## Next Steps : 

* **Complete Training Code:** Implement the training loop, loss function, and optimizer.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.) to optimize model performance.
* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model on a held-out test set using relevant metrics.
* **Deployment:** Deploy the trained model for real-world applications.
